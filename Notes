- Since cas authentication should redirect back to our website, please use fully qualified domain name instead of localhost. (even for browsing)
  Domain name can be configured with the following node command
  - require('node-fqdn')()
  - Browsers may automatically replace all capital letters with lowercase letters.
    So it would be better to use lowercased domain name.
    Or you can just add every possible domain names into REST serer cors header.
    - e.g. gtpd-columbo.police.gatech.edu instead of GTPD-Columbo.police.gatech.edu

- When running in "development mode"
  - Copy certificate file to webpack-dev-server/ssl
    - cp server.pem node_modules/webpack-dev-server/ssl/
  - Since session is used for cas authentication, the server should run under https protocol.
    But, unless the certificate is authorized one such as dashboard_police_gatech_edu_cert.cer,
      Chrome will not allow any api calls.
    In order to go around this issue, type chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost in the address bar and make it 'enabled'
  - Ports configuration
    - To run client on port XX, modify followings
      - client/.env --> PORT=XX
      - server/index.js --> res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://[domain_name]:XX"); (This is to enable cors)
    - To run server on port YY, modify followings
      - client/src/config.js --> module.exports.server = 'https://[server_domain_name]:YY'
      - server/index.js --> console.log("\n\n[Server] Starting server on port YY")
      - server/index.js --> .listen(YY, '0.0.0.0')


- Extras
    - Enable service worker for performance(but only on deployment)
